"""
Instruction format for the Duck Machine 2019W (DM2019W),
a simulated computer modeled loosely on the ARM processor
found in many cell phones and the Raspberry Pi.

Instruction words are unsigned 32-bit integers
with the following fields (from high-order to low-order bits).
All are unsigned except offset, which is a signed value in
range -2^11 to 2^11 - 1.

See docs/duck_machine.md for details.
